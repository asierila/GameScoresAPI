## Meeting 2.
* **DATE: February 24th, 2020**
* **ASSISTANTS: Mika Oja**

### 20 Minutes
In this meeting we went trough our database design and implementation.

### Action points
In this meeting we got some feedback:
In the database we had to change birthdate and time to date from string. We had to change foreign keys that had set_null to include nullable = true. Also those columns that had ondelete = "SET NULL" we had to add 'nullable = True'. We also had to add a small piece of code, from excercise 1 to enable foreign keys for SQLite in our code.

### Action points
Meeting 3 muistiinpanot ja kysymykset

In this meeting we discussed with Mika a lot about questions we had about design and implementation. Questions such as how game and games should be implemented.
In the meeting we reached to a following solution:
match should be transferred to  "api/games/game/match". Also what was discussed during this meeting was that we should implement two participants ("participant" and "participant2").

In addition to this discussion we had noticed during the meeting thigs such as that we had unnecesary items and that we should implement date with format rather than using a pattern, also
we had a sort by issue but this was a thing that was not required to fix.

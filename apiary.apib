# GameScoresAPI

GameScores API is a web API that stores game score data. The API serves JSON data extended by the [Mason hypermedia format](https://github.com/JornWildt/Mason). Custom link relations and resource profiles have been included in this API document - they are not resources.

# Group Link Relations

This section described custom link relations defined in this API. These are not resources. The API also uses 
[IANA link relations](http://www.iana.org/assignments/link-relations/link-relations.xhtml) where applicable. Custom link relations are CURIEs that use the mumeta prefix. 

## add-player

This is a control that is used to add a player to the associated collection resource. The control includes a JSON schema and must be accessed with POST. 

## add-match

This is a control that is used to add a match to the associated collection. The control includes a JSON schema and must be accessed with POST.

## add-game

This is a control that is used to add a game to the associated collection. The control includes a JSON schema and must be accessed with POST.

## matches-all

Leads to the root level matches collection which is a list of all matches known to the API. This collection can be sorted using query parameters as described in the resource documentation.

## games-all

Leads to the root level games collection which is a list of all games known to the API. This collection can be sorted using query parameters as described in the resource documentation.

## players-all

Leads to the root level players collection which is a list of all players known to the API. This collection can be sorted using query parameters as described in the resource documentation.

## delete

Deletes the associated resource. Must be accessed with DELETE

# Group Profiles

This section includes resource profiles which provide semantic descriptions for the attributes of each resource, as well as the list of controls (by link relation) available from that resource.

## Games Profile

Profile definition for all games related resources.

### 20 Minutes
In this meeting we went trough our database design and implementation.

### Action points
In this meeting we got some feedback:
In the database we had to change birthdate and time to date from string. We had to change foreign keys that had set_null to include nullable = true. Also those columns that had ondelete = "SET NULL" we had to add 'nullable = True'. We also had to add a small piece of code, from excercise 1 to enable foreign keys for SQLite in our code.
